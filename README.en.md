# Trellium

English | [简体中文](README.md)

Trellium is a portable Agent collaboration protocol: it installs and keeps upgrading the Agent collaboration layer of a project.

Its goal is not to generate a fixed tech-stack application template, but to give any project a stable layer of Agent collaboration capability: entry rules, project memory, task governance, acceptance gates, handoff, reusable workflows, and a collaboration profile.

## What this project solves

When developing with AI Agents over the long term, the common problems are rarely "the Agent can't write code". They are:

- A new session does not know the project's current state;
- The Agent has no clear authorization boundary;
- A task can't be handed off mid-way;
- Tests pass, but acceptance is never closed;
- Important decisions are scattered across chat logs;
- Context breaks when switching between multiple Agents or tools;
- Every project has to re-negotiate a set of collaboration rules from scratch.

Trellium converges these conventions into a single project-level collaboration protocol, so that once an Agent enters a project it knows:

- What context to read first;
- How to judge task level and authorization level;
- Which files carry runtime state, decisions, and handoff;
- When a task file must be created;
- How to verify that a task is complete;
- Which collaboration preferences can be captured, and which must not override hard rules.

## Core artifacts

The truly portable core of this repo falls into two categories:

```text
init/
skills/
```

`init/` is the protocol source directory. It maintains the complete design, initialization, and upgrade flow of Trellium.

`skills/` contains self-contained, directly installable Skill packages. Distilled from the `init/` protocol source, each package bundles the main workflow, a condensed protocol reference, the auto-synced authoritative protocol snapshot, and copy-ready templates. It does not depend on this repo's local path.

The `AGENTS.md`, `vault/`, `app/`, `tests/`, etc. in the repo root are validation artifacts that the current sandbox generates according to the protocol — they are not the migration source.

If you only want to install a self-contained Skill rather than migrate the full protocol source, use:

```text
skills/trellium/
skills/trellium-zh/
```

`trellium` is the English version, `trellium-zh` is the Chinese version.

## Usage

### New project initialization

In the target project, have the Agent read:

```text
init/INIT.md
init/protocol/README.md
init/protocol/60-initialization-flow.md
```

If the project type is already known, also read the matching profile, for example:

```text
init/protocol/profiles/python-backend.md
init/protocol/profiles/go-backend.md
```

The Agent should generate its own, according to the protocol, in the target project:

- Agent entry file, e.g. `AGENTS.md`;
- `vault/` project memory system;
- `vault/governance.md` collaboration governance rules;
- `vault/tasks/` task-contract rules;
- `skills/` reusable workflows;
- project source, tests, and dependency files as needed.

### Adopting an existing project

If the target project already exists and you only want to add the Agent collaboration layer, have the Agent read:

```text
init/INIT.md
init/protocol/README.md
init/protocol/70-adoption-flow.md
```

Adoption mode creates or updates only the Agent collaboration layer by default:

- Agent entry file;
- `vault/`;
- `skills/`;
- an optional, very short README collaboration note.

Do not modify business source, dependencies, tests, build, deployment, or CI configuration unless the user explicitly authorizes it.

### Using the open-source Skill packages

If your Agent environment supports installing Skills, you can install or copy one of these directories as a Skill package:

```text
skills/trellium/
skills/trellium-zh/
```

When the Skill is used, the Agent generates or merges the following into the target project according to the package's references and templates:

- Agent entry file;
- `vault/` project memory;
- task-contract governance;
- handoff and collaboration profile;
- `skills/agent-task/SKILL.md` starter workflow.

This Skill is suited for cross-project reuse; the full `init/protocol/` is better suited for continuing to design and maintain the protocol itself. Each Skill's `references/protocol-source/` is an authoritative snapshot generated from `init/` — do not edit it directly.

Reinstalling the Skill delivers the new templates, protocol snapshot, and bundled upgrade script. For an already-adopted project, have the Agent follow the upgrade flow in SKILL.md: `diff` (read-only report) → `upgrade --apply` (safe subset + conflict proposals) → agent semantic merge + user confirmation → `upgrade --complete`. Project data (runtime, handoff, decisions, tasks) is read-only to the script and is never replaced by templates.

### One-line install (any agent)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zlin101/trellium/develop/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Installs the English Skill package into the auto-detected agent directory (`$CODEX_HOME`/`~/.codex` → Codex; `~/.claude` → Claude Code). Common options:

```bash
... | sh -s -- --lang zh              # Chinese package (default: en)
... | sh -s -- --agent all            # install for both Codex and Claude Code
                                     # when omitted: auto-detects $CODEX_HOME/~/.codex → codex, ~/.claude → claude
... | sh -s -- --project              # into ./.claude/skills/ of the current project
... | sh -s -- --version 2026.09.1    # pin a version (default: resolves latest GitHub release)
... | sh -s -- --dir <path>           # any destination directory
```

Re-running the command upgrades in place (the package directory is replaced). The script does exactly three things: resolve the latest release via the `releases/latest` redirect, download the release tarball from GitHub, and copy one directory — audit it first with `curl -fsSL <url> | less` if you prefer.

### Installing the Skill via Codex

The recommended approach is to use Codex's built-in `skill-installer` to install this Skill directly from the GitHub repository. You do not need to clone this repo — you only need Codex installed locally and access to GitHub.

Chinese version:

```bash
python3 "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/.system/skill-installer/scripts/install-skill-from-github.py" \
  --repo zlin101/trellium \
  --path skills/trellium-zh
```

English version:

```bash
python3 "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/.system/skill-installer/scripts/install-skill-from-github.py" \
  --repo zlin101/trellium \
  --path skills/trellium
```

Restart Codex after installing so the new Skill takes effect.

An installed Skill does not auto-upgrade from the GitHub repository. **Protocol-template and updater changes do not require reinstalling the Skill**: add `--fetch` to any command to pull the latest tagged release and run it (cached under `~/.cache/trellium/`; downgrades are refused). Reinstalling is only needed when the Skill workflow (`SKILL.md`) or the script itself changes; the Codex installer refuses to overwrite an existing directory by default. Before reinstalling, confirm the local Skill directory has no custom modifications you want to keep.

If the repository has not been pushed to GitHub yet, first push a commit that includes `skills/trellium-zh/` or `skills/trellium/`, then let Codex install it.

### Using the script to adopt a project

`trellium.py` is the deterministic installer/upgrader and runs from two locations: `assets/trellium.py` inside a Skill package (the regular path for end users, distributed with the package), or `scripts/trellium.py` in a checkout of this repo (for protocol development and maintenance). `sync-skills.py` keeps the two identical; the commands below use the repo path.

To add the Agent collaboration layer to an existing project:

```bash
python3 scripts/trellium.py adopt /path/to/project
```

`adopt` only adds Agent collaboration files that are missing, by default:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `vault/`
- `vault/tasks/README.md`
- `skills/agent-task/SKILL.md`

If the target project already has an `AGENTS.md`, the script appends a marked Trellium section instead of overwriting the file. Existing `vault/*` and `skills/*` files are skipped by default; pass `--force` explicitly to replace them.

Before writing anything, the script preflights every output path. If preflight finds that an output file or any parent path inside the target is a symbolic link, an output file has multiple hard links, or a resolved path escapes the target, adoption fails before any write. File content is replaced atomically through a temporary file in the same directory. On platforms with `dir_fd` and `O_NOFOLLOW`, actual writes also walk from the filesystem root through anchored directory descriptors, preventing a post-preflight link swap from redirecting output. If a filesystem race is detected or an I/O failure occurs while writing, the script stops and explicitly warns that the target may contain partial changes.

After adoption, have the Agent read the following in the target project:

```text
AGENTS.md
vault/index.md
vault/runtime.md
vault/governance.md
```

### Upgrading adopted projects

When the protocol source evolves, adopted projects can follow along safely, without disturbing their own trajectory (Skill users: replace `scripts/trellium.py` with `<skill dir>/assets/trellium.py`; any command accepts `--fetch` to pull the latest tagged release without reinstalling the Skill):

```bash
python3 scripts/trellium.py diff /path/to/project              # read-only report
python3 scripts/trellium.py upgrade /path/to/project --apply   # execute the safe subset
python3 scripts/trellium.py upgrade /path/to/project --complete  # finalize resolved proposals
```

The upgrade splits collaboration files into two classes: **project data** (runtime, handoff, decisions, tasks, project, collaboration, and friends) is read-only to the upgrader and is never replaced by templates; **protocol files** (governance, index, tasks/README, skills/agent-task, the managed AGENTS.md region) may be refreshed, but local modifications are never silently discarded — when both sides changed, a proposal is written under `vault/.upgrade/<version>/` for the Agent to merge and the user to confirm. Upgrades are per-file opt-in (`--only` / `--skip`) and produce a standalone, revertable commit.

`adopt` records a stamp at `vault/.agent-init.json` (the content hash of each file at install time). Projects adopted before the stamp existed should first run `baseline <target>`. Format migrations for data files are defined entry by entry in `init/MIGRATIONS.md`: content is carried over, never dropped.

### Revising the protocol

To change Trellium itself, modify only:

```text
init/INIT.md
init/protocol/*
```

The `vault/`, `app/`, and test scaffolding in the current repo can be used to validate that the protocol is sound, but they are not the protocol source. The root `skills/` are distributable Skill packages distilled from the protocol source; after modifying the protocol you should check that they still align with `init/`.

After modifying `init/`, regenerate the authoritative protocol snapshot inside both the Chinese and English Skill packages:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync-skills.py
```

Check for drift without writing files:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync-skills.py --check
```

This script is only for this repo's release maintenance; it is not an install-time dependency for Skill users. CI runs the same check. `references/protocol-source/` is maintained entirely by the script; `SKILL.md`, the condensed `references/protocol-model.md`, and `assets/templates/` still require manual review and adjustment when protocol behavior changes. The sync script guarantees the protocol source enters the install package, but it does not pretend to automatically complete Chinese↔English semantic translation or template design.

When a change affects protocol templates shipped to adopted projects, update three things in step: `FILE_ROLES` in `scripts/trellium.py` (when files are added or removed), `init/MIGRATIONS.md` (append a migration entry), and `init/VERSION` (bump as needed). When publishing a version for `--fetch`, tag it: `git tag <version> && git push origin <version>` (matching `init/VERSION`).

## Protocol philosophy

### Task contract first

An Agent earns trust not by identity, but by task contract: it is authorized by the contract and closes the task against acceptance criteria.

A task contract includes:

- Goal and scope;
- Explicit non-goals;
- Necessary context;
- Authorization level;
- Allowed and forbidden changes;
- Acceptance criteria;
- Required verification;
- Memory-update and handoff requirements.

### Vault as project memory

The protocol generates a `vault/` in the target project to carry:

- Project positioning;
- Current runtime state;
- Governance rules;
- Long-term decisions;
- Task records;
- Handoff information;
- Collaboration preferences.

This way, when a new Agent, a different model, or a different tool enters the project, it can recover context from files instead of depending on chat history.

### Memory Compaction

The hot files (runtime, handoff, decisions) have explicit budget lines. The agent-task workflow checks budgets at task close; when a line is exceeded, it runs the five-phase compaction (measure → classify → restructure → verify → record): runtime is rewritten rather than trimmed, handoff keeps a rolling window, and decisions are indexed once past the threshold (bodies move to `vault/decisions/`, leaving a read-only-by-default index). Semantic judgments such as Superseded/Merged/Expired are only ever proposed and confirmed by the user in batch — compaction is always zero-loss restructuring, never deletion. Compaction produces a dedicated commit containing only `vault/` changes, revertible at any time.

Governance files (governance, collaboration) are activated by events: escalation events and compaction reviews produce governance-revision proposals, and collaboration preferences are captured at task close. The default reading path is leveled: `index.md` carries the built-in task-level and authority cheat sheet, and the full `governance.md` is read only for Level B/C work or when classification is unclear.

### Portable, not copying the sandbox

Do not copy the current repo's generated artifacts wholesale into a new project.

When using the full protocol source, the correct flow is:

1. Migrate or reference `init/`;
2. Have the Agent read `init/INIT.md`;
3. Generate the project's own collaboration layer according to the protocol;
4. Update the `vault/`, `skills/`, and profile artifacts based on the target project's reality.

When using a Skill package, the correct flow is:

1. Install or copy `skills/trellium-zh/` or `skills/trellium/`;
2. Invoke the Skill in the target project;
3. Let the Skill generate the target project's own `AGENTS.md`, `vault/`, and `skills/agent-task/` from its built-in templates.

## Current status

This repository is still in the protocol-design and initialization-scaffolding iteration phase.

The current focus is refining `init/` and `skills/`: the former as the protocol source, the latter as the installable Skill distribution package. Other generated artifacts in the root exist mainly to validate that the protocol is sound.

## Local verification

The current sandbox carries a minimal Python scaffold to validate the initialization flow:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

This does not mean Trellium is tied to Python. The Python and Go profiles are just examples of currently available project types.

## Commit boundary

If the goal is to release or migrate the Trellium protocol, commits should preferably be limited to:

```text
init/
skills/
README.md
scripts/
```

Unless there is an explicit need to update the current sandbox state, do not commit artifacts such as `vault/`, `app/`, `tests/`, or a target project's generated `skills/agent-task/` as protocol source. The root `skills/trellium*` packages are distribution artifacts and may be committed alongside protocol changes.
