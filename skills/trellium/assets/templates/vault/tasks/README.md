# Task Files

Use task files for tracked or governed work.

## Lifecycle

```text
draft -> active -> ready_for_review -> accepted
          |
          v
        blocked -> active
```

Use `superseded` when replaced by another task. Paused-and-shelved work moves
to `vault/parked.md`, it is not a lifecycle value.

## Task State Block

Level B/C task files carry a `trellium-task-state` block right after the
title. It is the single owner of lifecycle, authority level, the current
slice, and gate results (optional: `current_slice`, `gates`). Update it on
every status change; the `runtime.md` row is only a projection. Unknown
fields are invalid; changing a field's meaning requires a new
`schema_version`. The block never grants approvals: Allowed, Requires
Approval, Forbidden, and acceptance stay owned by the task body and the user.

Task files without the block are legacy: add the block the next time you
touch the task; do not batch-migrate history. `TASK-xxxx-review.md` ledgers
and `tasks/archive/` are cold history and do not carry a block.

## Naming

```text
TASK-0001-short-title.md
```

## Template

```md
# TASK-0001 - Short Title

<!-- trellium-task-state
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "task_id": "TASK-0001",
  "level": "B",
  "authority_level": 2,
  "lifecycle": "draft"
}

## Review Ledger

Multi-round review uses a `TASK-xxxx-review.md` ledger and converges in
batch, not through message ping-pong.
Statuses: `open` | `fixed` | `wont-fix` (with reason) | `needs-discussion`.
The checklist prefers the task file's Acceptance Criteria; `wont-fix` and
`needs-discussion` go back to the user.
Archive the ledger into the task file's Execution Record once converged (no
`open` or `needs-discussion` left).
